Project title: A novel method for classification of malware images using deep learning techniques
Description: Malware is a serious threat to cybersecurity, and its detection and classification are crucial for 
ensuring the safety of computer systems. Traditional methods of malware detection rely on signature-based or heuristic-based approaches, 
which are limited in their ability to detect new or unknown types of malware. Deep learning techniques have emerged as a promising 
approach for malware detection, and in this research, we investigate the use of the EfficientNet B0 network for malware classification
